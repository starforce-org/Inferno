Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code for the game server of [Inferno][4], a website for Pokémon battling. Pokémon Showdown simulates singles, doubles and triples battles in all the games out so far (Generations 1 through 7).

This repository contains the files needed to set up your own Pokémon Showdown server. Note that to set up a server, you'll also need a server computer.

You can use your own computer as a server, but for other people to connect to your computer, you'll need to expose a port (default is 8000 but you can choose a different one) to connect to, which sometimes requires [port forwarding][5]. Note that some internet providers don't let you host a server at all, in which case you'll have to rent a VPS to use as a server.

Pokémon Showdown is mostly developed on Chrome, and Chrome or the desktop client is required for certain features like dragging-and-dropping teams from PS to your computer. However, bugs reported on any supported browser will usually be fixed pretty quickly.
